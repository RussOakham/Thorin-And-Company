<h2>About</h2>
<p>
    The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
    recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the king of the Lonely Mountain when
    Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire,
    Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force.
    Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash
    action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to
    leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

        <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
        <p>
            In the year TA 2746, Thorin II was born to Dwarven prince Thráin II in the mountain city of The Lonely
            Mountain. Early in his youth, he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the
            dragon Smaug in TA 2770. While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated
            when he participated in the Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He marched with one of the Dwarven armies
            beneath the East-gate of Moria. At some point in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken tree
            branch found on the floor as a shield, he gained the epithet "Oakenshield," which would remain with him even
            in death.

            Fili and Kili
        </h3>
        <p>
            Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother Dís. They were also nephews
            of Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his
            long nose, the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's. As the youngest Dwarves, Fíli and Kíli had the
            sharpest eyes, and were often sent scouting or searching. It was they that found the Front Porch while in
            the Misty Mountains.
        </p>
        <p>
            With the other Dwarves, Fíli and Kíli encountered spiders and were later imprisoned by the Elvenking
            Thranduil. They escaped the cells thanks to Bilbo, traveling down the river in barrels until they reached
            Lake-town.
        </p>
        <p>
            Both brothers were killed while defending the mortally wounded Thorin Oakenshield in the Battle of Five
            Armies, and all three were buried with honor

        <h3>Oin</h3>
        <p>
            Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. Oin's uncle was King
            Fundin, the father of Balin and Dwalin. He usually wore a brown-hooded cloak when travelling. Óin fought in
            the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined with Thorin and Company on
            the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain wearing a brown hood.[2] Óin was one of the Dwarves who bet that
            Bilbo would come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin were usually in
            charge of preparing the fire for the Company as they were the most skilled out of the others. He fought in
            and survived the Battle of the Five Armies, and later settled in the Lonely Mountain with King Dain Ironfoot
            II along with many other dwarves of The Company of Thorin.

        <h3>
            Gloin
        </h3>
        <p>
            Glóin was born in TA 2783, after the Dragon Smaug desolated Erebor. He was the younger child of Gróin and
            younger brother of Óin.

            In TA 2799, Glóin was known to have fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar, the last battle of the War of the
            Dwarves and Orcs, though it is unknown what significance he did, being 16 years old.

            In TA 2879, in the Blue Mountains, while in exile, his son Gimli was born to him and an unknown wife. In
            March of TA 2941 in Bree, Thorin Oakenshield met by chance the wizard Gandalf the Grey, pushing Thorin to
            reclaim Erebor, so that Smaug wouldn't start an alliance with Sauron. When Gandalf mentioned hobbits, Glóin
            referred them as "simpletons" and also said that hobbits "would never dare to come within smelling distance
            of the nakedest dragonet new from the shell".

        <h3>Balin</h3>
        <p>
            Balin was likely born in the Lonely Mountain before the coming of the dragon Smaug. He had a younger brother
            named Dwalin, and was amongst those driven from their homes when Smaug attacked the Lonely Mountain.
            Afterwards, he may have lived in Dunland as a refugee, before fighting in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs
            which culminated in the Battle of Azanulbizar. Many years later, in approximately TA 2841, he accompanied
            Thráin II, the father of Thorin, when he attempted to go back to the Lonely Mountain himself, but Thráin was
            captured and lost.

        <h3>
            Dwalin
        </h3>
        <p>
            Born in TA 2772, two years after the dragon Smaug had desolated Erebor, Dwalin was the son of Fundin and
            younger brother of Balin. After fighting in the Battle of Azanulbizar at the age of 27, Dwalin accompanied
            Thrain the Second and Thorin Oakenshield to settle peacefully in the northern Ered Luin.

            Later in TA 2841, Dwalin, along with his brother Balin, and a few others accompanied Thráin when he left the
            Ered Luin to visit Erebor. The small party was dogged by the emissaries of Sauron. In TA 2845, Thráin was
            captured one night when he and his companions sheltered under the eaves of Mirkwood from a black rain. After
            a fruitless search for their leader, the Dwarves gave up and returned to Thorin to inform him the news.

        <h3>Ori</h3>
        <p>
            Ori lived in Thorin's Halls in the northern Blue Mountains for many years. In the year TA 2941, Ori became a member of Thorin's Company and travelled with Thorin, Gandalf, Bilbo Baggins, and the other dwarves on the quest for the Lonely Mountain, culminating in the death of Smaug. Finally, he and the other dwarves of Thorin's Company fought in the Battle of Five Armies, which he survived.[3]
